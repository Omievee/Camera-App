# Live Camera App


This is an app worked on at my previous position.

The camera live records the second the user launches the app and once the user clicks to save the file, it refreshes the camera and continues to record. In the background, the device is saving the file, processing, trimming, transcoding, and readying the file to beuploaded in a custom algorithm that checks the length of the response time from the server & gagues how much data to send accordinly.
